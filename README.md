-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Grey and blue 
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. for this I used a video to help people better understand the product and the service provided
